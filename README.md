Implementation of DIN 3990 - Calculation of load capacity of cylindrical gears in Python.

Currently implemented are
- DIN 3990-5 (Dezember 1987)

Note: This project cannot be considered a substitute for the official standard. Likewise, I cannot guarantee the completeness and accuracy of the calculations.
